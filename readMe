Abstract of the paper

Density-based clustering is able to find clusters of arbitrary sizes and shapes while effectively separating noise. 
Despite its advantage over other types of clustering, it is well-known that most density-based algorithms face the 
same challenge of finding clusters with varied densities.Recently, ReScale, a principled density-ratio preprocessing 
technique, enables a density-based clustering algorithm to identify clusters with varied densities. However, because 
the technique is based on one-dimensional scaling, it does not do well in datasets which require multi-dimensional scaling. 
In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional scaling method,namedDScale, which rescales based on the computed distance. 
It over-comes the key weakness of ReScale and requires one less parameter while maintaining the simplicity of the 
implementation. Our empirical evaluation shows thatDScalehas better clustering performance than ReScalefor three
existing density-based algorithms, i.e., DBSCAN, OPTICS andDP, on synthetic and real-world datasets.
